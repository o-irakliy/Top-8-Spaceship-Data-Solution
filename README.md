# Top 8% Spaceship Data Solution

## **Project Description: Cosmic Passenger Rescue**

### **Introduction:**

So, welcome to 2912. The Titanic spaceship is an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. There are almost 13,000 passengers on board. Rounding Alpha Centauri on the way to its first destination - the hot 55 Cancri E - the unwary spaceship Titanic encountered a space-time anomaly hidden in a cloud of dust. Unfortunately, he suffered the same fate as his namesake 1000 years ago. Although the ship remained intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to another dimension!

### **Data Overview:**
The project involves two datasets - train.csv and test.csv, representing the personal records of passengers.

### **Approach:**

### **Data Preprocessing:**
Cleaned and prepared the data, handling missing values and ensuring data integrity.

Feature Engineering: Extracted valuable features, including encoding categorical variables and creating new informative features.

### **Modeling Techniques:**

 - RandomForest
 - CatBoost
 - Gradient Boosting
 - LightGBM
 - XGBoost
### **Evaluation and Selection:**

Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics.
RandomForest emerged as the most effective model for the given task.

### **Conclusion:**
Through rigorous data analysis, feature engineering, and the application of various machine learning models, the project aims to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension. RandomForest, with its superior performance, was identified as the optimal model for making predictions.

### **Mission:**
Rescue the lost passengers, change history, and contribute to the ongoing interstellar mission. Your predictions will aid rescue crews in retrieving those lost in the cosmic anomaly.<br>
