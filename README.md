# Top 8% Spaceship Data Solution

Fortunately, the situation itself is irrelevant for the current technological progress, but it is a very interesting competition.

So, welcome to 2912. The Titanic spaceship is an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. There are almost 13,000 passengers on board. Rounding Alpha Centauri on the way to its first destination - the hot 55 Cancri E - the unwary spaceship Titanic encountered a space-time anomaly hidden in a cloud of dust. Unfortunately, he suffered the same fate as his namesake 1000 years ago. Although the ship remained intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to another dimension!<br>
